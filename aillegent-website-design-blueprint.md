# Aillegent Website Design & Content Blueprint - v2

> v2 (2026-07-19). Supersedes v1. Changes: How We Work + Company merged into **About**; products are now **Shilp, Eventik, Permit360** (A2Z 029 removed; Cloud Services & Cost Optimisation presented under Services only); **Data Engineering** added as a sixth service; site-wide wording pass (see §1 voice rules); visual direction updated to the approved light system.

## 1. Brand foundation

### Positioning

**Aillegent is the engineering partner for organisations building, deploying, and optimising intelligent digital products.** We combine product engineering, applied AI, data engineering, cloud infrastructure, quality automation, and cost optimisation - from a rapid MVP to a stable enterprise platform. We also build and run our own products, which is the strongest proof of how we work.

### Company facts (verified - from Permit360 deck, July 2026)

- Founded: 2025 · Headquarters: Gandhinagar, India
- Email: info@aillegent.com · Phone: +91 90283 21652
- Own products in market: Shilp, Eventik, Permit360

### Primary message

> Build faster. Scale confidently. Optimise continuously.

### Supporting message

From first product idea to secure production operations, Aillegent turns business requirements into reliable software, AI-enabled systems, and scalable cloud platforms.

### Brand voice

- Clear and practical; explain complex engineering in business language.
- Confident but evidence-led; never invent customer counts, savings, certifications, or performance claims. Placeholder proof must be visibly labelled until verified data replaces it.
- Outcome-oriented; lead with what a client can achieve, then show the engineering behind it.
- Precise; prefer "AI-enabled system" over vague claims such as "AI transformation".
- **Anti-repetition rule:** do not lean on a single word as a crutch. In v1 "workflow" appeared 35+ times; cap it at a handful of uses site-wide and prefer the specific noun - *process, operations, casework, research, decisions, day-to-day work, pipeline*. Watch the same for "requirement", "capability", "production", "optimisation".
- **No duplicated sections:** each major content block (delivery cycle, growth journey, capability grid, pyramid) lives on exactly one page in its full form; other pages may reference it with one line + link.

## 3. Shared visual and interaction direction (as approved)

### Visual language

- **Mood:** Premium, minimal, technical, human. Light and airy - not generic "futuristic AI".
- **Palette (fixed - matches the Aillegent trimark logo):** warm off-white base `#F4F6F1`; deep ink `#0C1320`; brand teal `#0E9E76`; electric mint `#25D79B`; electric blue `#3B7DE0`. Gradients only as accents (headline highlight words, progress arcs, pyramid tiers).
- **Typography:** Rubik - one family for everything (700/600 display, 400/500 body); IBM Plex Mono only for chart axis labels and cycle stage numbers. (Lora was considered and rejected - serif reads editorial, not engineering.)
- **Layout:** minimal and open - borderless cards (soft shadow only), hairline dividers instead of boxed strips, generous whitespace. Avoid box-in-box compositions.
- **No kicker/eyebrow labels** above headings (no "- THE NUMBERS" style mono labels). Headings stand alone.
- **Hero variety (no template sameness):** Home = full-viewport headline over a slow aurora gradient field (three soft brand-light blooms) with a faint engineering grid; overview pages (Services, Products, Industries, About, Contact) = centered, visual-free heroes; detail pages = left copy + right light visual card (each visual unique and meaningful to the page).
- **Imagery:** real product screenshots for Eventik/Permit360/Shilp when supplied; otherwise light, on-palette illustrative visuals. No stock office photography. No fake screenshots presented as real.

### Motion principles

- Motion shows progress, connection, or state change - never decorates idle space. No infinite decorative loops.
- Engine: anime.js reveals + Lenis smooth scroll. No WebGL/Three.js - the hero aurora is pure CSS.
- **Scroll-pinned signature sections** (screen stays fixed, visual advances with scroll): the delivery cycle (Home) and the brand pyramid (About). Tuned so a normal scroll completes them in a few seconds; on mobile and reduced-motion they collapse to static/auto-advancing sections.
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion throughout; identical information without animation.

### Signature interactions

| Signature | Lives on | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Delivery cycle (6 stages) | Home only | Fixed ring, stage 01 at top; gradient arc grows to the active stage; scroll-driven while pinned; keyboard accessible |
| Brand pyramid (3 tiers) | About only | Clean triangle; tiers light up in sync with the copy as the user scrolls |

### Button & CTA discipline (site-wide rules)

1. The header CTA ("Start a conversation") is the ONE persistent contact button - it never repeats as a second pill in the same viewport.
2. Inner-page heroes carry ZERO buttons; the Home hero carries one primary button + one quiet text link.
3. Cards use text links ("Explore →"), never pill buttons.
4. Two ending models: **overview pages** (Home, About, Services, Products, Industries) end with ONE unique full CTA band (one button, page-specific label); **detail pages** end with a slim "Up next →" bridge that chains to the next related page + one small text CTA to contact.
5. Bridge chains: services PE→AI→Data→Cloud→Quality→Cost→overview; products Shilp→Eventik→Permit360→overview; industries Finance→IP→AdTech→Recruitment→overview.
6. Page-specific CTA labels: About "Work with us" · Services "Let's figure it out together" · Products "Request a product walkthrough" · Industries "Discuss your domain" · PE "Plan your product build" · AI "Discuss an AI use case" · Data "Put your data to work" · Cloud "Review your platform" · Quality "Improve release confidence" · Cost "Find your savings" · Shilp "Request a Shilp walkthrough" · Eventik "See Eventik in action" · Permit360 "Book a Permit360 demo".
7. Target: ≤3 contact links per page (header, mobile menu, ending).
